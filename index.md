# Trading Wheels

**What is Trading Wheels?**
Trading Wheels is an online game for making wild bets on the stock market without spending your own sweet money.

**Objective of the Game:**
Get the highest return on your investment vs. other participants

## How it works
1. Each participant receives $5000 in fake game money to invest in real stocks every week.

2. The participant can “buy” stocks by filling out a form (sent via email to partipants) with the ticker (stock symbol: example AAPL for Apple) and quantity of the stocks they wish to buy. 

3. Competition begins Monday and winners are determined on Friday. The participant with the highest “return” is the winner of the week. Return = profit earned on the $5000 investment. For example, if you end with $5021 on your portfolio at the end of the week, $21 is your return.

**A few things to note:** 
* Participants must send their submissions before 9 AM EST Monday (i.e. before the markets open) to participate in a given week

* At least 95% of the portfolio must be stocks i.e. only 5% or less can be cash

## FAQ
**1. What does the winner get?**
Fame, glory and respect of fellow competitors

**2. Can I see other participant's selection of stocks? / Can others see my stocks?**
No, participants cannot see each other's portfolios. But participants can see the lists of stocks in competition in a given week. For example, if participant "XÆA-12" invests in 100 TSLA stocks and 20 FB stocks, other participants can only see that TSLA and FB are in the game but cannot see the which participant owns them.
